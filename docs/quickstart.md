# Quick start

If you like to have a rapid look at what the tonic service looks like, we encourage you to run the example service in docker. We also provide quick start guide for the lab project service, and a way to build the services directly, but you may want to read the complete (but still short) documentation instead of quick starting.


## Example service

The example service is simply for demonstration purposes. See the [Example service](./example.md) document for a detailed description.

### Compile and run

Requires Go v1.15 or newer.

Clone this repository, build the included services, and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/G-Node/tonic
cd tonic
make
./build/example
```

After calling the last command, the output should be similar to the following:
```
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Initialising database
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Initialising worker
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Initialising web service
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Setting up router
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Starting worker
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Worker started
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Starting web service
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Web server started
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 No server configured - skipping login and disabling login requirements
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 WARNING: Authentication is open!
```

By default the service runs on port 3000, so you can access the example form at http://localhost:3000

Type `ctrl+c` to stop the service.

### Docker

Clone the repository and build the image:
```
git clone https://github.com/G-Node/tonic
cd tonic
docker build -t local/tonic:example .
```

*NOTE:* Here the image is named `local/tonic` and tagged as `example`, but this could be named anything.

For the example, no options or external files are required to run:
```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 local/tonic:example
```
*NOTE:* The `--rm` flag will delete the container once it exits.

The `-p 3000:3000` option publishes port 3000 from inside the container to the host system's network (even externally). It makes the running container accessible at http://localhost:3000. If omitted, the container can be accessed from the container's internal IP address, which can be determined using `docker inspect`.

The output should be similar to the following:
```
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Initialising database
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Initialising worker
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Initialising web service
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Setting up router
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Starting worker
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Worker started
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Starting web service
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 Web server started
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 No server configured - skipping login and disabling login requirements
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:31:06 WARNING: Authentication is open!
```

Type `ctrl+c` to stop the service.


## Lab project service

The Lab project service requires a configuration and credentials to make calls against a GIN API and clone repositories. See the [Lab project service](./labproject.md) document for a detailed description.

### Configuration

The configuration is read from a file called `labproject.json` in the working directory where the service is launched.
The following configuration keys are supported:
```json
{
  "gin": {
    "web": "<web address for GIN service: required>",
      "git": "<git address for GIN service: required>",
      "username": "<service username: required>",
      "password": "<service password: required>"
  },
  "templaterepo": "<template repository: required>",
  "cookiename": "<session cookie name: optional (default: utonic-labproject)>",
  "port": "<port for service to listen on: optional (default: 3000)>",
  "dbpath": "<path to sqlite database file: optional (default: ./labproject.db)>"
}
```

If any configuration values marked `required` are not specified, the service will fail to start.
Omitting optional values will set and print the default value on startup.

### Compile and run

Requires Go v1.15.

Clone this repository, build the included services, and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/G-Node/tonic
cd tonic
make
./build/labproject
```

After calling the last command, the output should be similar to the following:
```
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Initialising database
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Initialising worker
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Initialising web service
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Setting up router
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Starting worker
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Worker started
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Starting web service
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Web server started
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Logging in to gin
tonic: 2020/10/02 13:56:13 Logged in and ready
```

By default the service runs on port 3000, so you can access the example form at http://localhost:3000

If the credentials are incorrect (see [Configuration](#configuration) above), the startup will fail.

Type `ctrl+c` to stop the service.

### Docker

Clone the repository and build the image:
```
git clone https://github.com/G-Node/tonic
cd tonic
docker build --build-arg service=labproject -t local/tonic:labproject .
```

The `--build-arg service=labproject` option specifies which service to build. If omitted, it will build the [Example](#example) service.

*NOTE:* Here the image is named `local/tonic` and tagged as `labproject`, but this could be named anything.

For the first run, an empty file must be created for the database that will be mapped into the container:
```
touch /path/to/labproject.db
```

To start the service run:
```
docker run -it --rm --publish 3000:3000 --volume /path/to/labproject.db:/tonic/labproject.db --volume /path/to/labproject.json:/tonic/labproject.json --name labproject local/tonic:labproject
```

*NOTE:* The `--rm` flag will delete the container once it exits.

The `--volume /path/to/labproject.json:/tonic/labproject.json` option places the configuration file (see [Configuration](#configuration) above) into the running container for the service to read. The path must be changed to a file on disk with the configuration values.
The `--volume /path/to/labproject.db:/tonic/labproject.db` option places the database file (see [Configuration](#configuration) above) into the running container for the service to read. It is important that the file already exists outside the container, otherwise it will be created as a directory on service startup and the service will fail with an error.

The `--publish 3000:3000` option publishes port 3000 from inside the container to the host system's network (even externally). It makes the running container accessible at http://localhost:3000. If omitted, the container can be accessed from the container's internal IP address, which can be determined using `docker inspect labproject`.

The output should be similar to the following:
```
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Initialising database
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Initialising worker
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Initialising web service
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Setting up router
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Starting worker
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Worker started
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Starting web service
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Web server started
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Logging in to gin (<gin web address>)
tonic: 2020/11/23 12:43:21 Logged in and ready
```

Type `ctrl+c` to stop the service.
